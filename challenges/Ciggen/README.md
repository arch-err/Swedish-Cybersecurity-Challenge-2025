*Ska du \*host\* ha en cigg eller?*

## Solution
1. Uuugh, we're given a piece of python code that does some cryptographic stuffz. I just want a quick flag, so I'll ask gemini to reverse-engineer this code to get my flag. The code gemini came up with is placed in `solve.py`
2. `./solve.py`


## Flag
**Flag:** `SNHT{d0nt_sm0k3_k1ds}`
